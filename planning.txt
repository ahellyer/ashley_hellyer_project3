tough love quotes:
“Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty place and I don’t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain’t about how hard ya hit. It’s about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done!” - Rocky

“All the world will be your enemy, Prince of a thousand enemies. And when they catch you, they will kill you. But first they must catch you; digger, listener, runner, Prince with the swift warning. Be cunning, and full of tricks, and your people will never be destroyed.” - Watership Down

'Do. Or not do. There is no try.' - Yoda

“I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying.” - Shawshank Redemption"

“In either game, life or football, the margin for error is so small. The inches we need are everywhere around us. On this team, we fight for that inch. On this team, we tear ourselves, and everyone around us to pieces for that inch. We claw with our finger nails for that inch. Cause we know when we add up all those inches that’s going to make the f**king difference between winning and losing, between living and dying.” - Any Given Sunday

“We are food for worms, lads. Believe it or not, each and every one of us in this room is one day gonna stop breathing, turn cold, and die.” “Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys. Make your lives extraordinary.” - Dead Poets Society


“Snap out of this. Stop being defined by what other people think of you… or how they disappoint you. It’s lonely at the top — you know that. What’s that song about overcoming professional and personal disappointments? Oh yeah. 'When you’re smiling, when you’re smiling, the whole world smiles with you…'” - Glee

"Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinner, calling someone else stupid won't make you any smarter. All you can do in life is to try and solve the problem that's in front of you"

"the harder you fall the higher you bounce"

"stop waiting for things to happen and go out and make them happen"

winners are not people who never fail but people who never questions

don't run away from challenges, run over them

don't stop when you are tired, stop when you are done

some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen

i'm not telling you it's going to be easy, I'm telling you it's going to be worth it 

don't blame people for disappointing you. blame yourself for expecting too much 

hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard

winners train, losers complain

if you want to be the best you have to do things that other people aren't willing to do

if your dreams don't scare you they aren't big enough 

you will never know your limits unless you push yourself to them

it never gets easier, you just get getter

nobody said it would be easy

the moment you give up is the moment you let someone else win 

right now someone is out there trying to take your spot. they're hungry for it, are you?

look in the mirror- that's your competition

if it doesn't challenge you it doesn't change you

do it for the people who want to see you fail

to give anything less than you best is to sacrifice your gift 

if it was easy everyone would do it 

it's going to be hard but hard is not impossible
